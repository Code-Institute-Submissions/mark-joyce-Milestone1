# 'Blue Wave' Digital Marketing Agency

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a Digital Marketing Agency website to showcase the service that the 'Blue Wave Agency' provides.
The website highlights the services the agency provides with 3 plans available and what each plan involves, as well as the
methods they use for helping businesses advertise online, a portfolio of past work, and a contact form.

## Live Website
The live website for the agency can be found [here](https://mark-joyce.github.io/Milestone1).

## UX

### User stories
As a potential client visiting the website I expect to see a showcase of what services the agency provides and a portfolio of their previous work with other clients.

As a paying client of the agency I expect to see the same results with my business that they promise on their website homepage and them carrying out the services of the plan I chose.

### Strategy
My aim in the design was to showcase the possibilities of working with the agency & converting those website visitors into paying clients.

### Scope
For potential clients, I wanted to provide them with an overview of what services the agency provides and how they are carried out with different methods. They would be able to check if the agency is the right fit for what they want and need, with the option to contact the agency if they are interested in working with them.

### Structure
The information is simply structured within one funnel-type page and is logically grouped. In the 'Methods' section, I wanted to show potential paying clients the methods of digital marketing the agency uses such as Facebook Ads & Google Ads, which are used to benefit the clients businesses in the way they want - possibly more sales, lead generation, brand awareness.

### Surface
The color scheme was chosen to create a friendly and natural feel with clean typography, and a blue wave moving at the end of the page to match the agency's name.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.4.1)

## Features
All the code behind these features can be found in the index.html file, with the help of the contents inside the asset folder i.e the CSS and Images.

- Custom logo created for the header/navbar of the agency website.
- Navbar with 4 different tabs that go directly to that section of the page when clicked, and the navbar collapses into a burger menu when under 767px in width.
- 'Work With Us' button is used to get visitors to interact with the page on landing, once clicked it brings them to the 'Our Services' section.
- In the 'Our Services' section, the services of each plan are shown, the 3 'Get Quote' buttons inside the cards bring the user directly to the contact section where they can email or call the agency. Also, a hover effect is created when the card is being interacted with (Cursor on desktop, touch on tablet/mobile).
- Inside the 'Methods We Use', the main services of the agency are listed with a corresponding image.
- The 'Portfolio' section shows work done with past clients, including the business' name, logo and a description of what they achieved with Blue Wave.
- The 'Contact Us' section gives the website visitors an opportunity to contact the marketing agency. When visitors fill out their details in the email form and click the 'Send Email' button, it changes to show a message that their email has been sent and thanks them for contacting the agency. This feature was possible with a JavaScript function included in the script.
- 'Back To Top' button is included in the footer for the benefit of the website visitor so they can navigate the website quickly and more efficiently as they're scrolling.
- Also in the footer, the 'Privacy Policy' and 'Terms of Service' links are included if the visitor needs to read them before making a decision to contact the agency to work with them.
- At the websites page end, a GIF of a wave crashing is used to represent the agency's name and to add a fun user experience.


### Features Left to Implement
Plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

- Add a live chat pop-up feature on the website so visitors can talk to support staff in real time and help them with any questions they have.
- Add more businesses worked with in the portfolio section as the agency grows and gets new clients.

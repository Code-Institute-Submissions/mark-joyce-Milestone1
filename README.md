# 'Blue Wave' Digital Marketing Agency

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my Digital Marketing Agency website to showcase the service that the 'Blue Wave Agency' provides.
The website highlights the services the agency provides with honest and upfront prices, as well as the
methods they use for helping businesses advertise online, a recent case study, and a contact form.

## Live Website
The live website for the agency can be found [here](https://mark-joyce.github.io/Milestone1).

## UX

### User stories
As a potential client (user) I expect to see a showcase of what services the agency provides and a portfolio of their previous work with other clients.

### Strategy
My aim in the design was to showcase the possibilities of working with the agency & converting those website visitors into paying clients.

### Scope
For potential clients, I wanted to provide them with an overview of what services the agency provides and how they are carried out with different methods. They would be able to check if the agency is the right fit for what they want and need, with the option to contact the agency if they are interested in working with them.

### Structure
The information is simply structured within one funnel-type page and is logically grouped. In the 'Methods' section, I wanted to show potential paying clients the methods of digital marketing the agency uses such as Facebook Ads & Google Ads, which are used to benefit the clients businesses in the way they want - possibly more sales, lead generation, brand awareness.
